# Sample Lit UX

A modified version of the [Lit tutorial](https://lit.dev/tutorials/intro-to-lit/), I've swapped the local data storage to be server based.

The UX now gets the todo's from my API, POSTs new ones to it and toggles the "done" state via a PUT request.

To run the project;
1. Make sure the API is running
2. Run `npm run start`

Note https://open-wc.org/guides/developing-components/getting-started/ was used to generate the project
