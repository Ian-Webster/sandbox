# Azure Functions

## Introduction
A collection of projects testing out different functionality in Azure functions.

Each solution has it's own readme explaining what is required to run the project

## Prerequisites

Although each solution has a readme there are some core setup steps you'll need if you want to run the projects locally without an Azure account;

1. Make sure you've installed the Azure workload for Visual Studio (use the Visual Studio Installer if you haven't) 
2. Install Azure Storage explorer - https://github.com/microsoft/AzureStorageExplorer/releases  
3. Install Azurite - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azurite?tabs=npm%2Cblob-storage#install-azurite  
4. Run Azurite - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azurite?tabs=npm%2Cblob-storage#run-azurite - if you run into policy issues see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-7.4
